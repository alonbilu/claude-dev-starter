## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-12

First versioned release with additions from production use. Backward-compatible — no breaking changes.

### Added

- **Tier-aware command behavior.** Commands that load context (`/resume-feature`, `/trim-context`) now detect whether the running model is Opus 1M (model ID contains `1m`) or another tier (Sonnet 200k). On Opus 1M they load eagerly (full feature directory, wider budget thresholds); on Sonnet they stay lean (CONTEXT.md + STATUS.md only, tighter thresholds). Works without user configuration. See `.claude/rules/ai-workflow.md` and `.claude/knowledge/decisions.md` ADR-003.
- **Claude Max plan question in `/setup-project`.** Asks whether the user is on `x5` Max (mixed Opus/Sonnet usage) or `x20` Max (always Opus 1M). The answer is stored in `PROJECT.md` under `claude.max_plan` and used by tier-aware commands as a fallback when model-ID detection alone isn't enough.
- **Optional `.claude/knowledge/codebase-map.md` pattern.** Template at `.claude/knowledge/codebase-map.md.template` — a short always-loaded file that catalogs the top-level structure, services, and key API endpoints of the project. Useful once the codebase grows past ~20 files. Generated on demand; setup wizard flags it as opt-in after the first feature ships.
- **Multi-repo hub variant documented.** `docs/MULTI-REPO-HUB.md` explains how to adapt the workflow for projects split across multiple repos (e.g. separate frontend + backend): hub repo owns feature docs, branches named the same across repos, commits per repo per step, cross-linked PRs. This is an OPTION — the default is still single-repo/Nx monorepo. Pointer added to `docs/WORKFLOW-OPTIONS.md` and `README.md`.
- **`docs/FUTURE-ROADMAP.md`** documenting intentionally deferred additions:
  - **`/briefing [scope]`** — on-demand deep-load of all code for a subsystem, tier-aware. Deferred until the right default scope vocabulary is learned from real projects.
  - **Multi-feature mode** — load 2–3 active features simultaneously on Opus 1M. Deferred until there's empirical evidence users need it (attention quality concerns).
- **Versioning introduced.** This `CHANGELOG.md` + a plain-text `VERSION` file at the repo root. Releases are git-tagged (`v1.1.0` for this one).
- **ADRs in `.claude/knowledge/decisions.md`**:
  - ADR-003: Tier-aware command behavior.
  - ADR-004: Optional codebase-map knowledge pattern.

### Changed

- `README.md` — adds Tier-Aware Commands paragraph, pointer to `MULTI-REPO-HUB.md` + `FUTURE-ROADMAP.md`, mention of the plan-tier setup question, Changelog link.
- `.claude/rules/ai-workflow.md` — adds a "Tier Awareness" section.
- `.claude/commands/setup-project.md` — adds the plan-tier question early in the flow; persists to `PROJECT.md`.
- `.claude/commands/resume-feature.md` — tier-aware load depth.
- `.claude/commands/trim-context.md` — tier-aware budget thresholds.
- `CLAUDE.md` — references `claude.max_plan` from `PROJECT.md` during session startup.
- `PROJECT.md` — adds a `claude:` block with `max_plan` field.

### Not Changed

- Core feature workflow commands (`/new-feature`, `/discuss-feature`, `/plan-feature`, `/start-coding`, `/update-status`, `/complete-feature`, `/create-pr`) — unchanged.
- Default stack (React + Vite + NestJS + Prisma + Nx + pnpm + Biome) — unchanged.
- Rules files split across 8 files — unchanged (consolidation remains a project-by-project judgement).
- Command names — `/trim-context` kept (not renamed to `/context-audit`) for backward compat; tier-aware logic added in place.
